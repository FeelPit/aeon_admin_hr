```python
# Ensure that the .env file is not included in the public repository.
# Add the .env file to .gitignore to prevent it from being tracked by git.

# Example .gitignore entry:
# .env

# Use environment variables to securely manage secrets.
# Ensure that any secret keys are stored in the .env file and accessed via environment variables in the code.

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Access the secret key using an environment variable
# Example usage:
# SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')

# Ensure that the .env file is properly secured and not exposed in the repository.

# Security Fix: Ensure that the .env file is not included in the repository
# by adding it to the .gitignore file. This prevents accidental exposure of secrets.
# Additionally, ensure that any sensitive information is accessed via environment variables.
